To onboard new accounts:

1. Check the admin panel to see users who have an active subscription and don't yet have a URL assigned to them 
2. Create their menu in webapp/static/menus.py and pick and order url
3. In webapp/views/order.py, create 2 routes: '/order-url' and '/order-url/payment'
4. For '/order-url' route: return handle_order_website_request(request, 'account_email', '/order_url', 'restaurant_display_name')
5. For '/order-url/payment' route: return handle_order_payment_request(request, '/order_url')
6. On AWS, take M3 orders completely offline. Download the current zip file and save database.db
7. Re-upload to AWS, making sure to use the downloaded database.db in the new upload
8. Once online again, go to the admin panel and associate an account with the order URL

Note: associate both online ordering url and website url at the same time
