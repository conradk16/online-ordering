Commision-based Sales: Selling Software to Restaurants - $200/Sale

No experience needed. We're looking for salespeople to get restaurants to sign up for our online ordering software. The software enables the restaurant's customers to place online orders for pickup. We will pay you $200 for every restaurant that you get signed up.

The selling process involves finding restaurants without online ordering, talking to owners, and getting them to sign up through our website. Our product costs anywhere from $39/month to $63/month depending on a few factors. Most restaurants without online ordering want it and are willing to pay for it!

If you are interested, send us an email with your phone number, your name, and times you are available for a quick call where we can go through the details.
