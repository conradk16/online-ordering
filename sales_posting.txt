Field Sales Job: Selling Software to Restaurants - $200/Sale

We're looking for salespeople to sell our online ordering software to restaurants. The software enables the restaurant's customers to place online orders for pickup. The job is fully commission-based and we pay $200 for every restaurant that you get signed up.

The selling process involves finding restaurants without online ordering and getting them to sign up through our website. Feel free to take whichever approach works best for you, whether that's cold calling restaurants or going in person and talking face to face with owners. 

There are many restaurants that don't already have online ordering. Even if they already use Grubhub and DoorDash they can still benefit from our product. Grubhub and DoorDash focus on delivery and take 20-30% commission, whereas our software enables customers who are browsing the restaurant's website to place a pickup order online instead of calling in their order. This improves the customer experience and enables restaurants to handle more orders at any given time. Our product costs around $50/month and does not take commission. We also offer website creation and hosting for restaurants that want online ordering but don't yet have any online presence.
