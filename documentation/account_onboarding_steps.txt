To onboard new accounts:

1. Check the admin panel to see users who have an active subscription and don't yet have a URL assigned to them
2. Create their menu in json format
3. Go to the admin panel and associate the account with an order_url, the json menu, and the other necessary details

Note: associate both online ordering url and website url at the same time

To add columns to the database:

1. Download the live database
2. Type "sqlite3 database.db" to open a connection
3. Add a column to user table: "alter table user add column {{COL_NAME}} type {{COL_TYPE}};
4. Add a column to order table: "alter table [order] add column {{COL_NAME}} type {{COL_TYPE}};
5. For {{COL_TYPE}}, select an option from the "Affinity Name Examples" here: https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#affinity_name_examples
5. Quit sqlite3 with control-d (saves automatically)
6. Now the database has the new columns
